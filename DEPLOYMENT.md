# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed
1. **Directory Structure Error**: Vercel was trying to build from the wrong directory due to monorepo structure
2. **Missing Dependencies**: The build was failing due to missing `@prisma/client` and `bcrypt` packages
3. **Database Access**: Client was trying to access database directly instead of through API calls

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed monorepo structure** - Configured Vercel to build from the client directory
2. **Removed problematic dependencies** - Eliminated `@prisma/client` and `bcrypt` from client
3. **Updated API routes** - Client now forwards requests to server instead of direct database access
4. **Cleaned up package.json** - Removed unnecessary dependencies that were causing build failures

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js framework
4. The build should now succeed with the new configuration

### 3. Environment Variables (Required)
You'll need to set these environment variables in Vercel:

**Clerk Authentication:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` (e.g., `/sign-in`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` (e.g., `/sign-up`)

**Optional:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL` (e.g., `/`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL` (e.g., `/`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_IS_SATELLITE` (set to `false` for main app)

**Server Connection:**
- `SERVER_URL` (URL of your backend server, e.g., `https://your-server.vercel.app`)

### 4. Build Settings
- **Framework Preset:** Next.js
- **Build Command:** `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `client/.next`
- **Install Command:** (leave empty, handled in build command)

## Alternative Deployment Method (Recommended)
Since the monorepo approach is causing issues, the easiest solution is to deploy directly from the `client` directory:

1. **In Vercel dashboard:**
   - Set the **Root Directory** to `client`
   - Remove the `vercel.json` file completely
   
2. **Deploy normally** - this will build directly from the client directory

**Note:** The `rootDirectory` setting is configured in the Vercel dashboard, not in `vercel.json`.

## Troubleshooting
- If you still get build errors, check that all environment variables are set
- Ensure your Clerk keys are valid and active
- Check that your Next.js version (15.4.4) is compatible with Vercel
