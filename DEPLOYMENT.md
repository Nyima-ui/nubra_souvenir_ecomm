# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issue Fixed
The original error was caused by Vercel trying to build from the wrong directory. Your project has a monorepo structure with the Next.js app in the `client` subdirectory.

## Solution Applied
1. **Created root-level `package.json`** - This helps Vercel understand the project structure
2. **Created `vercel.json`** - This tells Vercel exactly how to build your project
3. **Updated build command** - Now Vercel will `cd` into the client directory before building

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js framework
4. The build should now succeed with the new configuration

### 3. Environment Variables (Required)
You'll need to set these environment variables in Vercel:

**Clerk Authentication:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` (e.g., `/sign-in`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` (e.g., `/sign-up`)

**Optional:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL` (e.g., `/`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL` (e.g., `/`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_IS_SATELLITE` (set to `false` for main app)

### 4. Build Settings
- **Framework Preset:** Next.js
- **Build Command:** `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `client/.next`
- **Install Command:** (leave empty, handled in build command)

## Alternative Deployment Method (Recommended)
Since the monorepo approach is causing issues, the easiest solution is to deploy directly from the `client` directory:

1. **In Vercel dashboard:**
   - Set the **Root Directory** to `client`
   - Remove the `vercel.json` file (or set Root Directory to `client` in vercel.json)
   
2. **Or modify vercel.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "rootDirectory": "client"
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy normally** - this will build directly from the client directory

## Troubleshooting
- If you still get build errors, check that all environment variables are set
- Ensure your Clerk keys are valid and active
- Check that your Next.js version (15.4.4) is compatible with Vercel
